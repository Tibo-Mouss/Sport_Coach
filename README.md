# Sport_Coach
 
Thats a little helper to those who do sports at home. It creates automatically a list of exercices to do.

My brother had an app and i wanted to do the same, just for fun. It works on a point base system, the more difficult an exercice is, the more points is attributed to it, and so a workout session corresponds to a certain amount of points to get with exercices.

It has some other features like timer, track records of workouts sessions, and the last thing i wanted to do was to be able to see what was the exercice by showing a video example when you click on the exercice's name. It's not working fully unfortunately and i don't plan to continue working on this project anymore, but it was fun though.
